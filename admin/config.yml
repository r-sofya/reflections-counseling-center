              Original text: Many people are looking for a Christian Faith-based
              counselor. They want someone who has successfully faced and
              overcome personal struggles with God's help using the Bible as the
              highest standard of truth. Michael earned the bachelor's degree in
              Theology in 1983 and has been using Bible based counseling since
              1987. Michael regularly prays for God to speak through him in
              sessions where God's spirit heals the clients. Michael offers this
              type of therapy to those seeking God's help., key: 34b0b9ff

              skills at home because of the way they were raised. Abuse, neglect
              and abandonment leaves many with extra challenges to attend to
              their family's emotional needs. Our commitment at Reflections is
              to teach you focus and rapport building skills and offer

              clients have/ had as an opportunity to realize, assess, and solve.
              We take time to listen, set plans and goals based on my training
              and over 35 years of experience to equip each person that walks
              through our doors. You can be assured of complete confidentiality
              as the laws provide for your safety, and your personal issues are
              sealed between you and your therapist unless you share it yourself
