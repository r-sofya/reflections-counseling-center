My name is Faith Harrak. I am the office manager of Reflections Counseling Center. My hope is that you will experience our family style of safety and acceptance when you come to visit us. 
I have been working for RCC since 1999, 24 years later I have learned so much about people. Life is full of surprises & adventures. 
My personal journey starts with me earning my diploma/degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1988 at the top of my class and was offered a position at the university as a field instructor. Instead, I migrated to the U.S. working in various fields not related to my degree. 
I personally delight in the balance of adventure and well-being. Faith, Nature, Music, and Decor are the essentials of everyday life. I find such joy in experiencing the connection between these elements.
My business journey has been forever evolving. In 1999 I was offered an Administration opportunity at Reflections, within one year, I become the Office Manager, and it has been a fun ride ever since. 
My Spiritual journey bas been the best thing that ever happened to me! I accepted Christ as my Savior back in 2004, and I have been serving God's people and Reflections joyfully. I am so thankful to God for His Divine plans! I want to assure you that I will give you my best effort to take care of your concerns from the first call to the last goodbye. Simply said, I find myself admiring every person that walks through our door. I am so honored to serve clients who are taking the steps to acknowledge their issues and positively work on solving them! Please give us a call and let us be part of your journey to healing.
