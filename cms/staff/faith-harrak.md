Hi again! You are looking at a small window of our home at work. I can say life is full of surprises & adventures. While I earned my diploma/degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1988 at the top of my class, and was offered a position at the university as a field instructor. Instead, I migrated to the U.S. working in various fields not related to my degree. I was offered an opportunity as an office manager at Reflections and it has been a fun ride ever since. I accepted Christ as my Savior back in 2004, and I have been serving God's people and Reflections joyfully. I am so thankful to God for His Divine plans! I want to assure you that I will give you my best effort to take care of your concerns from the first call to the last goodbye. Simply said, I found myself admiring every person that walks through our door. You may ask why? I'd say I am honored to serve clients who are taking the steps to acknowledge their issues and positively work on solving them! Please give us a call, and let us be part of your journey to healing.
