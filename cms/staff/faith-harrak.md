Hi again! You are looking at a small window of our home at work. I can say life is full of surprises and adventures. In 1988 I earned my degree at the top of my class. Therefore, I was offered an instructor position at the university in my field. Instead, I migrated to the U.S. working in various fields not related to my degree. I was offered an opportunity as an office manager at Reflections and it has been a fun ride ever since. I accepted Christ as my Savior back in 2004, and I have been serving God's people and Reflections joyfully. I am so thankful to God for His divine plans! I want to assure you that I will give you my best effort to take care of your concerns from the first call to the last goodbye. Working at Reflections, I found myself admiring every person that walks through our door. You may ask why? I'd say I am honored to serve clients who are taking the steps to acknowledge their issues and positively solve their problems which improves their lives as well as those around them!

Please give us a call and let us be part of your journey to healing.
