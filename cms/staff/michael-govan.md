About Me
--------

I love people and my passion is to help them become unstuck and resolve the issues that keep them from flourishing. I been married for 46 year, have 2 grown children, and grandson. I enjoy playing guitar. I love being a therapist, and will help you to clarify not only your problems, but also the strengths you already have to work things through. Believing in you from the start provides the hope many clients need in order to solve life's difficulties. Sometimes you will be working on the underlying issues from which your problems originate. At other times, the work will focus on understanding how these issues still impact your decisions and behaviors. Much of your time you will be watching your issues literally melt away! After your first appointment, Michael will prepare a diagnosis and treatment plan to share with you. Once clients see the roadmap of where the healing process will go, it becomes easier to participate with the therapist to reach mutually agreed upon goals. Add to this the therapy process called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) an amazing discovery that helps restore lives torn by **TRAUMA, ANXIETY** and **PHOBIAS**.

Whether you come in for the specialized area of Christian Counseling, or to target other overwhelming issues that are interfering with your life harmony, Â come in and find out why Michael has well over a 95% success rate in helping clients achieve their goals! He'll help you achieve yours!!!
