  I went to 5 different therapists and all of them couldn’t have cared less if I
  had killed myself or not. They just wanted to make sure my insurance worked.
  Reflections Counseling is THE BEST. Mike is the man. He knows his stuff, one
  of the best trauma therapists in Michigan. He is amazing at helping people
  heal and cope. Faith is the greatest office manager that ever was! Very
  compassionate. I wouldn’t send anyone I know anywhere else. If you actually
  want healing, go here!
