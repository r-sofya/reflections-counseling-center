  Mike is an excellent therapist and was able effectively help me. He is very
  skilled using EMDR. He works with you to develop your goals and a plan to get
  there. He helps you to follow the plan and measures success along the way. It
  helps to have a structured plan to work with to actually meet your goals. He
  is very friendly and easy to speak with. Faith, the office manager, keeps on
  top of your appointments to make sure you have a weekly appointment if things
  are fluid and works with your schedule. I don't have anything negative to say
  about going there.
