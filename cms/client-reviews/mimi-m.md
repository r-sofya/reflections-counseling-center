  Have had great results with Mike. Heâ€™s a caring and knowledgeable professional
  with a lot of experience. He did wonders helping to heal my trauma with EMDR.
  Truly a miracle. Also, not sure about some of the other reviews but my
  experience has been 100% positive - especially with the honest - and TIMELY -
  billing practices. I used to go to a place and the insurance would be billed
  three months later. Top notch all the way around in my experience. Faith
  (receptionist) is also very lovely to deal with - also smart and honest and
  very accommodating. Highly recommend.
