  Mike is an excellent therapist and was able to effectively help me. I went to
  several different therapists; he was the ONLY one I feel connected on the
  first meeting. Any questions/problems I brought up, he listened very patiently
  and provided me solutions. The skills and approaches for communication Mike
  gave me and my husband totally changed our marriage. It is actually working!
  Highly recommended!!
