  When you enter the office, you are greeted by Faith, a very friendly
  receptionist. Michael is a caring therapist. He has different methods to help
  you achieve the goals that you brought to the office. Several times I shed
  tears but felt so much better afterwards. This is talk therapy that works.
  Between Faith and Mike, they make you feel like family!
